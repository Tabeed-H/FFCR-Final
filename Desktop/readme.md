# Desktop Front-End Application

This is the main folder for the front-end application, which serves as the interface for interacting with the core features of the project. It includes all necessary assets, source code, and configuration files required to build and run the application.

## Folder Structure

The `Desktop` folder is organized into several subfolders and files:

- **[assets](#assets)**: Contains images, icons, and other static resources used throughout the application.
- **[src](#src)**: Holds the main source code for the application, divided into logical components for maintainability.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, to avoid committing unnecessary or sensitive files.
- **package-lock.json**: Auto-generated file that records the exact versions of dependencies used, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **package.json**: Configuration file that contains metadata about the project, dependencies, scripts, and other settings.

### assets

The `assets` folder includes all static files such as images, icons, fonts, and other resources that are used in the application. These are essential for the visual appearance and user interface elements.

- **Images**: Visuals that enhance the user experience.
- **Icons**: Small graphical elements used throughout the UI for better navigation and functionality.
- **Default**: Contains the default facial components.
- **RE-JK**: Contains Region (RE) specific facial components.

### src

The `src` folder contains the main source code of the application, including both frontend logic and component-based UI development. It is organized to separate concerns and provide a clear structure for development.

- **Main**: Backend logic or core processing scripts.
- **Renderer**: Frontend components, styles, and user interface elements.

### .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file ensures that sensitive or unnecessary files are not tracked by version control. It typically includes:

- `node_modules/`: Dependencies that are installed via npm.
- `*.log`: Log files generated during development or runtime.
- `*.env`: Environment files containing sensitive information like API keys.

### package-lock.json

This file is automatically generated and should not be edited manually. It locks the versions of dependencies installed via npm, providing a consistent environment across different setups.

### package.json

The `package.json` file is crucial for managing the project, including its dependencies, scripts, and metadata. Key sections include:

- **Scripts**: Commands to run, build, and test the application.
- **Dependencies**: Lists all libraries and packages required for the application.
- **DevDependencies**: Tools needed only during development, such as linters or testing frameworks.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js and is used to manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desktop Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/Desktop
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
